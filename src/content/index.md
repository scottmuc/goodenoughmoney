# Welcome to Good Enough Money

This website is a collection and synthesis of the resources I've found most valuable
on my personal finance journey. This journey started in 2016 after watching a video
by [Mr. Money Mustache][mmmtalk].

In the most recent years, I got more into learning more generalized principals of
personal finance and found [Benjamin Felix's][csi-advice] video on what is good
financial advice down-to-earth, and compromised of things I learned on my own over
the last few years. He later released an excellent paper on
[Finding and Funding a Good Life][funding-life].

My goal with this website is to condense what I've learned over the past 8 years into
a resource that can get anyone started.

## Goal Formation and Quantification

Determining what is Enough is not a trivial thing, but knowing that there is some amount
of wealth that's enough can help one define a financial plan that saves them from working
too much.

## Asset Allocation

How to have things balanced such that you can sleep comfortably at night.

## Insurance Needs Analysis

Protecting yourself from extreme downside risks.

## Financial Product Allocation

Knowing what products to put in your portfolio is only a portion of setting yourself
up for a healthy financial future.

## Tax Awareness

Prevent suprise tax bills and know how to only pay necessary taxes.

## Disipline and Habits

Given that you'll need to apply and monitor this plan for your entire life, you'll need
to create systems and habits that help you stick to the plan.

# Resources

## Books

There are many books on this subject, and I've only read these 4:

* [Psychology of Money][psych-money]

* [Your Investment Philosophy][invest-phil]

There are many other books on improving your life and all that jazz, but the above books
are directly related to one's financial future.
