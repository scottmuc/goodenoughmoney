# goodenoughmoney

This website is intended to be a journal/manual of my personal finance strategy.

# Site Rules

* Never be selling. Never vouche for software or services I have never used.
* Keep things brief. Folks are already overloaded with financial information.
* Document my personal journey. If I don't do what I say, then this website is
  a waste of time for everyone involved.
